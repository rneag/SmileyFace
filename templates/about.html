<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm coming home again<br>
    Do you think about me now and then?<br>
    Do you think about me now and then?<br>
    'Cause I'm coming home again<br>
    I met this girl when I was 3 years old<br>
    And what I loved most she had so much soul<br>
    She said "Excuse me lil homey, I know you don't know me<br>
    But, my name is Windy and I like to blow trees"<br>
    And from that point I never blow her off<br>
    Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off<br>
    They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off<br>
    And make 'em straighten up their hat 'cause she know they soft<br>
    And when I grew up she showed me how to go downtown<br>
    In the nighttime her face lit up, so astounding<br>
    I told her in my heart is where she'll always be<br>
    She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave<br>
    She said it felt like they walked and drove on me<br>
    Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me<br>
    I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me<br>
    She said "'Ye, keep making that keep making that platinum and gold for me!"<br>
    I'm coming home again<br>
    Do you think about me now and then?<br>
    Do you think about me now and then?<br>
    'Cause I'm coming home again<br>
    Do you think about me now and then?<br>
    Do you think about me now and then?<br>
    'Cause I'm coming home again<br>
    Maybe we can start again<br>
    But if you really cared for her<br>
    Then you wouldn't have never hit the airport to follow your dreams<br>
    Sometimes I still talk to her, but when I talk to her<br>
    It always seems like she talking 'bout me<br>
    She said, "You left your kids, and they just like you<br>
    They want to rap and make soul beats just like you<br>
    But they just not you" and I just got through<br>
    Talking 'bout what niggas tryna do, just not new<br>
    Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong<br>
    I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone<br>
    I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home<br>
    And guess when I heard that? When I was back home<br>
    Every interview I'm representing you, making you proud<br>
    Reach for the stars so if you fall, you land on a cloud<br>
    Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around<br>
    If you don't know by now, I'm talking 'bout Chi-Town!<br>
    I'm coming home again<br>
    Do you think about me now and then?<br>
    Do you think about me now and then?<br>
    'Cause I'm coming home again<br>
    Maybe you, do you remember when?<br>
    Fireworks at Lake Michigan<br>
    Oh, now I'm coming home again<br>
    Maybe you, do you remember when?<br>
    Fireworks at Lake Michigan<br>
    Oh, now I'm coming home again<br>
    Maybe we can start again</p>
